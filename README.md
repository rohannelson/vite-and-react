# About This Repo

A friend advised me that if I wanted to get work in web development, [React](https://react.dev/) would be a good skill to have. 
I'd also kept hearing about [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), so I thought I'd try using React with Vite rather than [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

I started learning React with the official React [Tic Tac Toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe), and then thought making some more board games would be both fun, and a good way to consolidate what I had learned.

After I'd built a few games, I merged this repo with [my personal website](https://rohannelson.com/projects).
